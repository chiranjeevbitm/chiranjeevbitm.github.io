          <h1>Chiranjeev Kumar</h1>
          <h2>Tech Blogs + Data Science engineer</h2>

          <p>Hi,
            This is Chiranjeev, graduated from Bit Mesra in 2020, I joined TCS in 2020.
            I love working in Artificial Intelligence technologies like Machine Learning, Data Science, and Cloud computing.
            Won a Machine Learning Hackathon in my college, also was runner up in The Smart India Hackathon.
            I have done some interesting projects on Machine Learning and participated in Kaggle competitions.
            I have done an Internship from IIT Kanpur in IOT field and also did some projects in IoT field.

            These new technologies excite me to learn more and more in these fields.
            I look forward to work in Artificial Intelligence and IoT fields and keep improving my skills in these fields.
            Recently one of my research paper was published in Elsevier publication, It was in field of Machine Learning detecting corona virus using the chest scan images.<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077921000667" target="_blank">Science Direct journal</a>
            <p> I will be posting some interesting machine learning and Data Science related projects.</p></p>

            <h3>Covid-19 detection using chest scan image dataset(99% acc)</h3>
            <p>This repo contains covid-19 detection with three algorithms , CNN , ResNet 50 and VGG 16 . out of which I got best accuracy with vgg16 as 98.8%• Dataset of chest X-ray is downloaded from Kaggle.com and it is visualised for the proper understanding of the data before processing. Data augmentation is applied on the images so that it can effectively classify the covid-19 cases.• CNN is proposed for the detection of covid-19 and hence controls the fast spreading covid-19 cases.• Pre trained deep learning model that is transfer learning algorithm VGG-16 is used to increase the accuracy of the proposed model.</p>

            <h3>Temperature Dependent auto cooling system (IoT)</h3>
            <p>In this project, I took the dataset from https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/repositories/malaria-datasets/ . and performed machine learning algorithm to predict the infected blood cells In the dataset we get two types of microscopic images of blood cells.After performing the CNN algorithm on the train data we get the accuracy upto 98% Then I have standarized the whole sample image into equal dimension so that, Machine Learning algorithms can be easily deployed.</p>
